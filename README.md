# WebScraper
Utilizing the BeautifulSoup library in Python to web scrape from a test site on webscraper.io (a legal and free to use platform to practice web scraping). File tabletScraping.py is where the work is actually done, scraping from https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/tablets. webScrapingTrial.py is playing around with the BeautifulSoup library and understanding the methods.

# Motivation
I decided to create a web scraper utilizing Python to further increase my knowledge and skillset in the language all while grabbing useful information for future web development.

# Build Status
Complete, no future additions/commits.
